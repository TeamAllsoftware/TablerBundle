# Using the layouts

3 pre-implemented layout are available for the `reset-password` form.

It is inspired by `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle@1.11`.
See here: https://github.com/SymfonyCasts/reset-password-bundle

File name and variable/from name follows what `reset-password-bundle` as generated by default.
You can of course, override everything if needed.

In order to use the layouts, you should extend the one you want from `security/reset_password/`:
- check_email.html.twig
- request.html.twig
- reset.html.twig

Here's an example for the request form with email.
```twig
{% extends '@Tabler/security/reset_password/request.html.twig' %}

{% block logo_login %}
    <a href="." class="navbar-brand navbar-brand-autodark">
        <img src="{{ asset('images/logo.svg') }}" height="36">
    </a>
{% endblock %}
```
